*** Hello World ***
This is just a little test project for testing the way git and github works
Let's see how I can deal with changes on the server
But what happens if there are some solvable conflicts?
Change done by TortoiseGit
Another change that is conflicted by the server
Some additional stuff added during the merge process

Hello World is so cool!!
